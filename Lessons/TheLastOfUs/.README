# The Last Of Us

The Last of Us takes place in the year 2033, twenty years after a fungal-based, brain-altering pandemic has spread
and infected over 60 percent of the world's population. Since the outbreak, the world has gone into a state of panic and
frenzy as officials try to fix and keep the situation under control. When the World Health Organization's attempts to
procure a vaccine fail, the United States government does away with the bureaucrats in power and the establishment of
civilian government. The country is turned into a police state under the control of homeland security and the military, 
and cities across the nation are placed under martial law one by one. Survivors of the pandemic are assigned to designated
quarantine zones that are supposed to separate them from the infected and keep them safe.



Sometime within the twenty years leading up to the main events of the game, a paramilitary group calling themselves the 
Fireflies is established, with their main goal being the restoration of lawful government in the United States, as well as
finding and producing a vaccine for the Cordyceps brain infection. The Fireflies attack the military on occasion and encourage 
uprisings.

# Learn , Discover , Explore!
In this .py you can learn alot from what I did and discover methods I use to make things work! This is very Novice level friendly
and if you find yourself lost just make sure to look at the comments next to the lines of code to see what each line does and why 
I added those functions and how they are being implmented. again this is very user friendly and very easy to understand I made
these projects so someone new to coding can learn and develop skills like I have to make their own programs and have somewhere to
start in the world of coding!

# Twitch
I also stream my progress on Twitch and store the broadcasts so subscribers can rewatch and see how i made them from scratch! I stream for hours
at a time and make sure to stop by and ask me any questions or , Chat , watch my progress!
