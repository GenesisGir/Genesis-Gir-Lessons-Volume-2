# AMMO FUNCTIONS MORE AMMO


Welcome to the ammo , functions , more ammo .py! in this script we are using modules, print(), variables, functions,
string concatanation and more to apply the logic we need to make this program run programming is about creativity and
this project has tons of that! review the source code to learn more about why we are doing the actions we have
this program tells user his/her inventory amount than makes them wait 5 seconds to retrive 100 bullets of ammunition
in turn after we are using flow control staements to make user choose if they wish to close the program with the
'y/n' text values. Combining flow control and other methods to compact code is the fun and interesting part of coding.
import statements and moudle names like sys,webbrowser,time do various actions google the modules to see what each module does
and you can use them in your own projects!
